# 🎉 Instrumental Maker - Web UI Implementation Complete!

## What Was Done

I've successfully created a complete copy of your instrumental-maker project in `/volume1/docker/stacks/instrumental-maker` with a brand new, modern web UI that follows your infrastructure patterns and design preferences.

## ✨ Key Achievements

### 1. **Modern Web UI Created**
   - **Frontend**: Beautiful responsive design using Tailwind CSS 3
   - **Backend**: Flask 3.0 RESTful API with Server-Sent Events
   - **Theme**: Sleek light/dark mode toggle with smooth transitions
   - **Design**: Inspired by Plex, Jellyfin, and *arr apps with gradient accents
   - **Features**: Dashboard, queue management, library browser, file uploads, live logs

### 2. **Full Traefik Integration**
   - All services properly configured with Traefik labels
   - Uses existing `proxy` network
   - Follows project patterns (priorities, middleware, naming)
   - SSL certificates handled by existing wildcard setup
   - No exposed host ports (everything through reverse proxy)

### 3. **Services Deployed**

## 📋 Next Steps for You

### 1. DNS Configuration (Required)
Create these A records in Cloudflare:
```
instrumental.nsystems.live          → <your-server-ip>
instrumental-files.nsystems.live    → <your-server-ip>
instrumental-deemix.nsystems.live   → <your-server-ip>
instrumental-minio.nsystems.live    → <your-server-ip>
instrumental-s3.nsystems.live       → <your-server-ip>
```

### 2. Security Updates (Recommended)
```bash
# Edit .env file
nano /volume1/docker/stacks/instrumental-maker/.env

# Change these values:
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=<generate-a-random-secret-key>
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secure-username>
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=<your-secure-password>
```

### 3. Test the Stack
```bash
cd /volume1/docker/stacks/instrumental-maker

# All services are already running! Check status:
docker compose ps

# View web UI logs:
docker logs -f instrumental-webui

# Once DNS is set, visit:
# https://instrumental.nsystems.live
```
